Horns adorned his head like a crown, yet his face seemed so incredibly tender. This all-powerful Demon King seemed as a new born child. His eyes gazed off into the distance, not bothering to lock eyes with you or the Kijohime's body."],

The mainland sinks back into the old underworld as chaos unfolds anew. A new world is born and the Daimaou rules over this realm with an indomitable iron fist. You are transformed by his will into a terrible four-headed dragon larger than mountains. You enforce his dominion my force and fire, and wield four vessels of his power. A form befitting a true servant of the Daimaou."]
