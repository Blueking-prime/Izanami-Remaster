You were on the ground, on grass. Farmers around you hail you as a God, \u2018the Chosen Warrior\u2019. Among them you see those that you recognize, but completely changed, as though their memories and personality were rewritten from the ground up. Even their names evade you now. The harder you try to remember the more fleeting they seem, and the more your head begins to hurt. Eventually you give up, knowing that some things were better forgotten. You are again surrounded by a group of kind faced angels, and lifted into the sky, floating carelessly towards the castle. It felt... impossibly peaceful. And so it were that you fell into a deep sleep again, having done what you'd promised, you rest. What even was the promise... the memory evades you, but you do not mind, knowing that some things were better off forgotten."]]}}
